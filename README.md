- It is bank transaction website. It is simple website developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript. user can log in and send and retrieve money.
- I did not use and backend as it is a simple website. But I have defied array of list users and their password in my javascript programming.So user name wcich are in the array can login. 
- In future if I want to develope it more I will add backend functionality with REST API.
