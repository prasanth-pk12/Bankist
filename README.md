# Bankist Website
As a web developer, I designed and developed a bank transaction website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website features user authentication with an array of usernames and passwords, allowing users to log in and send or retrieve money. Although I did not include backend functionality in the initial version, I plan to implement it in the future with a REST API. By doing so, I aim to improve the website's performance, security, and scalability.
