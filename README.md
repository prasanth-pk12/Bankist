# Bankist Website
I have developed Bankist, a bank transaction website using frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website provides users with an interactive interface to manage their financial transactions. It includes features like user authentication, displaying account details, transaction history, and basic fund transfer functionality. At present, the project does not have backend functionality implemented. The focus has been on creating a seamless and user-friendly experience while prioritizing the security of user data.
